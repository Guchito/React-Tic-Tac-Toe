# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with React and JavaScript.

## Game Description

This is a basic implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where two players, X and O, take turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
